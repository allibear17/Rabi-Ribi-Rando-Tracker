WIP for a map location tracker to help with Rabi Ribi rando.

Feel free to download the files and run index.html locally or use the 
gitpage for it at https://allibear17.github.io/Rabi-Ribi-Rando-Tracker/

All item locations should be marked with a transparent white square.
Some items are marked with a colored outline, these should be obtainable with varying degrees of difficulty.
Left click AND right click cycle the marker icons.
A debug tooltip is left in, showing "marker#" in the top left. Please use this to refer to incorrect data.

If you would like to help feedback, corrections or improvements are welcome.

Big thanks to sigonasr2 for all the improvements made in such short time.
