# Rabi-Ribi-Rando-Tracker
WIP for a map location tracker to help with Rabi Ribi rando.

This map serves as the basis of starting this tracker.
White Squares are item locations that we know to be available without any movement or bomb items.
Black Circle Items are visible but not obtainable without some bomb or movement items.
The Red Squares are danger locations, be careful and save before checking.
Pink markers (slanted rupees?) are slide required items.  We definitely do not have these all marked and might change this later.
