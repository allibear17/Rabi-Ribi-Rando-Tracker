WIP for a map location tracker to help with Rabi Ribi rando.

Feel free to download the files and run index.html locally or use the 
gitpage for it at https://allibear17.github.io/Rabi-Ribi-Rando-Tracker/

All item locations should be marked with a transparent white square.
Some items are marked with a white outline, these should be obtainable without any items whatsoever.
Left click AND right click cycle the marker icons.
A debug tooltip is left in, showing "marker#" in the top left.

If you would like to help feedback, corrections or improvements are welcome.
